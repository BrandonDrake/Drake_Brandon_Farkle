to reach 10,000 points. Each player will roll

*************
SETUP
*************
This game requires at least 2 players, but there is not
upper limit on the number of players.

*************
SCORING
*************
> Each 1 is worth 100 points.
> Each 5 is worth 50 points.
> Three pair is worth 100 times the face value. 
	(Three 2's is 200 points, 5's is 500 points)

*************
GAMEPLAY
*************
> First player rolls six dice at the same time and "sets aside" any point dice 
  (1's, 5's, three of a kind) that are rolled.

> At this point, player can either choose to roll the remaining dice to collect more
  points, or keep the current point values.

> If a player rolls the dice, either on the initial roll or the reroll, and not point dice
  appear, this is called a FARKLE. The player loses all the collected point dice for that 
  turn and no points are added to the player total score.  Play advances to the next player.

> In order for the player to initially enter the game and record points, the player must first
  score at least 1,000 points during one turn.  Once the player is entered into the game, the 
  player may stop rolling at any time and record the collected points on future rolls.

> If a player decides not to roll, the current points for that turn are recored to the player's
  overall score.  Play advances to the next player. 

> If a player collects all six dice as point dice and are set aside, the player must roll all
  six dice at least one more time, before stopping and keeping points collected. 

*************
STRATEGY
*************
All point dice do not need to be set aside.  If a player rolls a 1 and a 5, it may be best to
set aside the 1 and reroll the five to possible collect higher point dice or roll a three of a kind.

*************
WINNING
*************
> First player to record 10,000 points or greater is the winner.

> After player gets over 10,000 points, each player has one turn to try and beat the first player who
  goes out.  If none of the other player beats the score, that then he/she is the winner. If the score
  is beaten, then that new player wins.
